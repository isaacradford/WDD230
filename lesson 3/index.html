        <h1>Site Name:</h1>
            <p>The name of the bank that I chose is The Bank of Idaho. It's a local bank to where I grew up in Idaho Falls,
                and I liked the colors that they generally use, and so I wanted to use them as an example.</p>
        <h1> Site Purpose:</h1>
            <p>The purpose of the website is to create a trustworthy environment and website that will let customers trust us with their money.
                It should have everything they need to know how to create an account, manage their money, and connect with the professionals in a way that
                is easy to understand and flows well. </p>
        <h1>Domain Name: idahoanbank.com</h1>
            <p>The domain name I chose is idahoanbank.com. It's pretty straightforward and available, so that made it easy.</p>
        <h1>Logo:</h1>
                <p> The logo I chose is this one from Google Icons. I might change the color to match with the rest of the website, but this is the general look.</p>
