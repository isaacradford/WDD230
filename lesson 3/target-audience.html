            <h3>Sergio De Paula</h3>
                <p id = 'scenario_text'>This eager looking man is Sergio. Sergio is wanting to become a small business owner in the city of Idaho Falls, Idaho.
                    He wants a bank that understands the needs of small, local business owners like him, and there's no bank that gets that better
                    than the Bank of Idaho. As a local company ourselves, we understand his needs. Our website should be able to answer his questions like, 
                    'What are my next steps for getting a loan?', 'How do I schedule an appointment,' or even 'How do I get started?' 
                </br> (Note: I didn't come up with these names, they were what they were named on Unsplash.)

            <h3>Jonas Kakaroto</h3>
            <p id='scenario_text'>
                This interested looking man is named Jonas Kakaroto. Jonas and his wife, Emilia, are looking to buy a house and need a mortage.
                Our website should be able to give them the assurance they need and answers to questions like, 'Which type of mortage is best for me?',
                'Do I qualify for any payment assistance programs?', and even 'What's the first step for us?' We want to make these type of life transitions 
                as easy as possible so we can have as many citizens like Jonas and Emilia in our community.
